# E-commerce Admin Repository


This repository is part of the final project for the Hack Academy intensive course. The project was developed in collaboration with Ioel Katz and María Clara Puñales over approximately three weeks.


The project consists of an e-commerce platform, including:  

A user-facing frontend: https://crownmotors-user.vercel.app

An admin panel: https://crownmotors-admin.vercel.app/login

A backend API to support the application.


We worked together on all three repositories. You can find the others here:

User Frontend Repository: https://github.com/fortizsenattore/ecommerce-user

Backend Repository: https://github.com/fortizsenattore/ecommerce-backend
